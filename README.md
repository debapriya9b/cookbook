Python & Flask - Data Centric Development  - Milestone Project 3 for Code Institute by Debapriya Bhattacharya

---
## Project Purpose:
To build a full-stack site that allows users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain.Users make use of the site to share their own data with the community, and benefit from having convenient access to the data provided by all other members.

## Project Summary
CookBook is a full recipe website built on *Flask* as the backend and incorporates *MongoDB* as the Database, *Bootstrap* as well as *Materializecss* as a CSS Framework and Vanilla JavaScript.

CookBook is where the art of cookery made plain and easy.Users can create their own free account and add an unlimited number of recipes to share with the world! If users like some of the recipes that other's have submitted, they can share their opinions by clicking on Like or Dislike buttons.Users can edit,delete their own recipes whenever required.

I tried to keep the website very simple userfriendly.Hope you enjoy viewing and using this site as much as I have had building it!
