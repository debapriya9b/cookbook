Python & Flask - Data Centric Development  - Milestone Project 3 for Code Institute by Debapriya Bhattacharya

## Project Summary

# Project Purpose:
To build a full-stack site that allows users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain.Users make use of the site to share their own data with the community, and benefit from having convenient access to the data provided by all other members.

Foodie is a full recipe website built on *Flask* as the backend and incorporates *MongoDB* as the Database, *UIKit* as a CSS Framework, Vanilla JavaScript and *PyGal* for charting with Python.

The concept and usage of the website is based on world cuisines that users have the ability to view, search, filter, search and filter, edit, delete, create, leave comments and much more.

I wanted the website to closely represent a real world website of the same nature and have tried to include as many features as possible that makes the site both user friendly and encourages the user to stay on the site and make use of all the features (Which are documented in the [Features](#Features) section of the README). 

The website on launch contains 398 recipes sourced from [BBC Good Food](https://bbcgoodfood.co.uk). To include this vast amount of recipes I built a web scaper with [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/), and built another python script to *insert_many* to my MongoDB Database.

I hope you enjoy viewing and using this site as much as I have had building it!
