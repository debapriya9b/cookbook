Python & Flask - Data Centric Development  - Milestone Project 3 for Code Institute by Debapriya Bhattacharya

## Project Summary

The purpose is to build a full-stack site that allows users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain.Users make use of the site to share their own data with the community, and benefit from having convenient access to the data provided by all other members.

The objective for this milestone project is to "*Create a web application that allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes*", using the **CRUD** operations of **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete for their recipes.

CookBook is an online recipe website built on **Flask** as the backend and incorporates **MongoDB** as the Database, **Bootstrap** as well as **Materializecss** as a CSS Framework and **Vanilla JavaScript**.

CookBook is where the art of cookery made plain and easy.Users can create their own free account and add an unlimited number of recipes to share with the world! If users like some of the recipes that other's have submitted, they can share their opinions by clicking on Like or Dislike buttons.Users can edit,delete their own recipes whenever they wish.

I tried to keep the website very simple and user friendly.Hope you enjoy viewing and using this site as much as I have had building it!

## UX

I have decided to build a Cookbook, since I personally love food and always try out new recipes from different public sites like Cooking blogs, youtube etc. This was the perfect opportunity to finally have a single application to contain all of my favourite recipes in one source. A lot of people often ask me for specific recipes, so now I can quickly provide a single source for all of my tried and tasted recipes. It also allows others to store their own recipes securely.

### User Stories

- "I love cooking!Whenever I come across a good recipe I note it down.But it is very difficult to access those recipes all the time,you cannot carry your cooking book everywhere.Right?So it will be great if I can have it online in one place."
- "I want to view the site from any device like mobile,tablet,laptop"
- "Is it possible to view all the recipes without registering or logging in?"
- "What if I post my recipe and later want to change it or delete it?"
- "I am not that computer savy,so cannot use a very complicated website."
- "I love cooking but those measurements are always confusing for me.If I get a quick reference where I can see the standard cooking conversion table it will be great"

## Design

### Framework

- [Materialize](http://archives.materializecss.com/0.100.2/)
    - To give a modern and clean layout.
    
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/)
    - Easy to use.Easy documentation.

- [jQuery 3.4.0](https://code.jquery.com/jquery/)
    - Used to simplify some of the DOM minipulations.
    
- [Flask 1.0.2](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
    - Flask is a microframework that I've used to render the back-end Python with the front-end Materialize and Bootstrap 4.

### Color Scheme

The concept for Cookbook is to make cooking fun and easy, so to keep the overall site welcoming, I have opted for a bright and colorful color scheme. These standard [Materialize Colors](http://archives.materializecss.com/0.100.2/color.html) work quite well for my project.

### Icon

[Materialize Colors](http://archives.materializecss.com/0.100.2/icons.html) has been used for this project.
