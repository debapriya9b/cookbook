Python & Flask - Data Centric Development  - Milestone Project 3 for Code Institute by Debapriya Bhattacharya

## Project Summary

The purpose was to build a full-stack site that allows users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain.Users make use of the site to share their own data with the community, and benefit from having convenient access to the data provided by all other members.

The objective for this milestone project is to "*Create a web application that allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes*", using the **CRUD** operations of **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete for their recipes.

CookBook is a full recipe website built on *Flask* as the backend and incorporates *MongoDB* as the Database, *Bootstrap* as well as *Materializecss* as a CSS Framework and Vanilla JavaScript.

CookBook is where the art of cookery made plain and easy.Users can create their own free account and add an unlimited number of recipes to share with the world! If users like some of the recipes that other's have submitted, they can share their opinions by clicking on Like or Dislike buttons.Users can edit,delete their own recipes whenever required.

I tried to keep the website very simple userfriendly.Hope you enjoy viewing and using this site as much as I have had building it!

## UX

I have decided to build a Cookbook, since I personally love food and always try out new recipes from different public sites like Cookinf blog,youtube etc. This was the perfect opportunity to finally have a single application to contain all of my favourite recipes in one source. A lot of people often ask me for specific recipes, so now I can quickly provide a single source for all of my tried and tasted recipes. It also allows others to store their own recipes securely.
